histAfric basically started as Tripgh in January 2015. The main aim of this platform was to serve ghanaians and expatriates the ability to view interesting places in ghana, provide a little history with high quality images and the ability to find hotels surrounding such places. Tripgh was supposed to generate reviews which would influence peoples decision on visiting places. The idea was very competitive and challenging. On moving on, I realised other software entrepreneurs both ghanaians and non-ghanaians(TripAdvisor etc) had explored that space and added more functionality. I pivoted to Tourgh. This was also a platform that could serve any user with the rich ghanaian historical places we had, provide accurate history and high quality images. I guess this was in the same line with earlier idea(TripGh), just that this was to be more precise and focused on rich ghanaian history. I vividly researched on this space and i noticed that we as ghanaians didnt have a central point where all our history history were kept on the internet so i took up that challenge to create this central point. On moving on with this project and much research with validations, i noticed that Africa in general has great history and people will like to know or read about us. How will they be able to do that, a possible solution was to search on google and get other websites or blogs having these histories, but you needed to navigate through soo many websites to be able to find little information you needed to know about these countries you want the history from. Therefore i decided to expand Tourgh to focus on Africa. Thus creating a hub of history in Africa. So i changed the name from Tourgh to histAfric which basically means History of Africa. 
histAfric is a centralized online platform that history of all historical places in Africa with beautiful images, reviews and likes. The vision of this platform is to be a central point of information when any history is being searched within Africa. The users of this platform is not restricted but opened to anyone who like to know the beautiful history we have behind some beautiful historical places we have in Africa even before any visitation could be made. histAfric content is reviewed by some top historical academic personnels in ghana and it's opened to any personnel who is engraved with much knowledge with any of the historical post on this platform.
