Form the research i made, i realized that Ghana doesn't have a central point where we have all our historical places with pictures and history, but rather it is scattered over the internet making it very difficult for both citizens and non citizens to read and look at the hostorical places we have in the country. For instance people who visit Ghana are likely to visit these places as a way of knowing much about the country and having fun. What is being done currently is randomly asking people or IF they know any place in ghana, they search on google. Google brings out the search results pulling from different blogs. some blogs contains picture of the place, other blogs dont. so it makes it much more difficult for them to find. This is where tripGh comes in.
TripGh is a web app that aims at displaying historical places in ghana. The app allows both citizens and non-citizens to know much about the history of Ghana and some interesting historic places.It does this by not only showing the places but also adds history for those interested to read and know more. TripGh allows other users to also share their experience about the place. 

******Features******

2. Allows users to share their experience on each place they visit.

**** I don't know if i should add interesting places aside the historical places. please what do you think about that?
